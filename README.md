- 👋 Hi, I’m @ajalloul
- 👀 I’m interested in game, mobile, and website development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS serverless stack including API Gateway/Lambda/DynamoDb and am applying them to my current project
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with devs of any kind. We grow by working together and I hope youve got something cool to work on :P. I love learning and 
hope whatever we do is cool!
- 📫 Reach me by my email adnanmjalloul@gmail.com or via my github account. If I am not mistaken you can dm me. Feel free to hit me up. I  love to talk to people about 
new projects and possibilities.
